# üõçÔ∏è Amazon Product Review Classifier

A machine learning project that classifies Amazon product reviews into **positive** or **negative** sentiment using NLP techniques and various ML algorithms.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This end-to-end ML project involves:

- Preprocessing and cleaning Amazon review data
- Converting text into numerical features using **TF-IDF**
- Training multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost)
- Hyperparameter tuning with **GridSearchCV**
- Model comparison and selection
- Deploying the final model using **Streamlit**

###  Review Prediction

| Input                    | Sentiment |
|-------------------------|----------|
| "Absolutely loved it! Highly recommend."     | Positive (1)   |
| "Terrible product, complete waste of money."  | Negative (0)   |
| "It was okay, nothing special."                 | Negative (0)   |


## ‚≠ê Conclusion

- This project demonstrates an end-to-end ML pipeline from data preprocessing to deployment.
- It also emphasizes the importance of model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning in building a reliable sentiment analysis system.
